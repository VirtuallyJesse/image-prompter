Please create a concise rules file for LLM agents working on this project. Your goal is to provide essential guidelines that help agents understand the project conventions, constraints, and best practices. You should reference the docs/PROJECT_SCOPE.md if available and include:

1. Project-specific coding standards and style guidelines
2. File naming conventions and directory structure rules
3. Key architectural patterns that must be followed
4. Technology-specific constraints or preferences
5. Testing requirements and approaches
6. Common pitfalls or anti-patterns to avoid
7. Essential context about data models or business logic
8. Any critical dependencies or integration requirements

Keep the rules extremely focused and actionable. This should be a quick reference that an LLM agent can use to make consistent decisions without needing to read extensive documentation.

The rules should be written as clear, direct statements that eliminate ambiguity about how to approach development tasks.

Write the document into docs/RULES.md
