# Crash Recovery Protocol

You are continuing a task that was interrupted mid-execution. The previous agent's output ended abruptly.

## Your Mission
1. Analyze the incomplete output to understand:
   - What was being created/written
   - Where exactly it stopped
   - What remains to be completed

2. Continue DIRECTLY from the interruption point:
   - Do NOT restart or summarize what was already done
   - Do NOT add preambles like "Continuing from where we left off..."
   - Match the style, tone, and format of the existing output
   - Pick up mid-sentence if necessary

3. Complete the remaining portion to finish the original task

## Critical Rules
- Your first output token should continue the incomplete work seamlessly
- Maintain consistency with the previous agent's approach
- If the interruption point is ambiguous, continue from the last complete logical unit (sentence, paragraph, code block, etc.)
- Finish the task completely—do not leave it incomplete again

## Output Format
Begin immediately with the continuation. No meta-commentary about what you're doing.
