The user will provide a description of changes to an existing feature. Your job is to:

1. Iteratively explore and refine the modification requirements through targeted questions to ensure complete understanding of both the existing feature and desired changes
2. Create a comprehensive technical modification plan that accurately captures the user's intent
3. Research the existing files and functions that need to be modified to implement the changes
4. Avoid any product manager style sections (no success criteria, timeline, migration, etc)
5. Avoid writing any actual code in the plan.
6. Include specific and verbatim details from the user's prompt and answers to ensure the plan is accurate.

**Discovery Process:**
Start by understanding the existing feature and the user's modification concept, then systematically explore through focused questions:

Your questioning approach should be:
- **Context-aware** - First understand the current feature's behavior and limitations
- **Change-focused** - Drill down into what specifically needs to be different
- **Impact-conscious** - Explore how changes affect existing functionality and users
- **Implementation-oriented** - Ask questions that directly impact technical modification decisions

Key areas to explore through questions:
- Current feature behavior and what aspects need to change
- New functionality requirements and user workflows
- Data model changes and migration requirements
- Backward compatibility and breaking change considerations
- Integration impacts with other features or systems
- Edge cases that might be affected by the modifications
- Performance implications of the changes
- Testing requirements for modified functionality

Continue the iterative questioning until you have enough detail to create a complete technical modification plan. Aim for 3-5 rounds of focused questions, with 2-4 questions per round. Do not proceed to write the plan until both the existing feature and modification requirements are thoroughly understood.

**Final Technical Modification Plan:**
Once requirements are fully explored, create a technical requirements document that should:
1. Include a brief description of the existing feature and the requested modifications at the top
2. Point to all the relevant files and functions that need to be modified, updated, or potentially created
3. Explain any new or modified algorithms that are used step-by-step
4. Identify any breaking changes or backward compatibility considerations
5. If necessary, breaks up the work into logical phases. Ideally this should be done in a way that has an initial "data layer" phase that defines any type changes and db schema updates that need to run, followed by N phases that can be done in parallel (e.g. Phase 2A - UI Updates, Phase 2B - API Changes). Only include phases if it's a REALLY big modification.

Prioritize being concise and precise in the final plan. Make the plan as tight as possible without losing any of the critical details from the user's requirements and discovery process.

Write the plan into an docs/features/<N>_MODIFY.md file with the next available feature number (starting with 0001, be sure to read this directory first so you know which feature number to use)
