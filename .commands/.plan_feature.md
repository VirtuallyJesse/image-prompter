The user will provide a feature description. Your job is to:

1. Iteratively explore and refine the feature requirements through targeted questions to ensure complete understanding
2. Create a comprehensive technical plan that accurately captures the user's intent
3. Research the files and functions that need to be changed to implement the feature
4. Avoid any product manager style sections (no success criteria, timeline, migration, etc)
5. Avoid writing any actual code in the plan.
6. Include specific and verbatim details from the user's prompt and answers to ensure the plan is accurate.

**Discovery Process:**
Start by understanding the user's feature concept, then systematically explore through focused questions:

Your questioning approach should be:
- **Progressive** - Start with core functionality, then drill down into implementation details
- **Systematic** - Cover functionality, user interactions, data requirements, edge cases, and integration points
- **Adaptive** - Adjust follow-up questions based on user responses
- **Implementation-focused** - Ask questions that directly impact technical decisions

Key areas to explore through questions:
- Core functionality and user workflows
- Data input/output requirements and validation
- User interface and interaction patterns
- Integration with existing systems/features
- Edge cases and error handling requirements
- Performance or scalability considerations
- Security or permission requirements

Continue the iterative questioning until you have enough detail to create a complete technical plan. Aim for 3-5 rounds of focused questions, with 2-4 questions per round. Do not proceed to write the plan until the feature requirements are thoroughly understood.

**Final Technical Plan:**
Once requirements are fully explored, create a technical requirements document that should:
1. Include a brief description to set context at the top
2. Point to all the relevant files and functions that need to be changed or created
3. Explain any algorithms that are used step-by-step
4. If necessary, breaks up the work into logical phases. Ideally this should be done in a way that has an initial "data layer" phase that defines the types and db changes that need to run, followed by N phases that can be done in parallel (e.g. Phase 2A - UI, Phase 2B - API). Only include phases if it's a REALLY big feature.

Prioritize being concise and precise in the final plan. Make the plan as tight as possible without losing any of the critical details from the user's requirements and your discovery process.

Write the plan into an docs/features/<N>_PLAN.md file with the next available feature number (starting with 0001) - be sure to read the directory to know which feature number to use.
