We're currently returning non-ephemeral errors for slash commands. Can we improve this?
e.g. for /image

if this happens:

=== GEMINI API ERROR DEBUG === {
  "stack": "ApiError: {\"error\":{\"code\":500,\"message\":\"An internal error has occurred. Please re

  we are sending:

   🔧 Server Error. google's servers are having issues. try again in 30s! 

   directly into the discord channel. When these errors happen, and ONLY IF the active task is a slash command, can we return them as ephemeral? We'll still need to maintain real text respose error returns for non-slash commands. 

   It's just image API errors are by far the most common, and image commands are only used in slash commands, so I'd like to give slash commands more care.
